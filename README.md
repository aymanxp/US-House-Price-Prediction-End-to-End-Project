🏡 US House Price Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning project to predict house prices in the United States using real-world data scraped from property listing websites.

📌 Introduction

House prices in the United States vary widely depending on factors such as location, number of rooms, lot size, and other property features. Having a reliable predictive system can help buyers, sellers, and real estate investors make informed decisions.

This project aims to build a full end-to-end machine learning pipeline that:

Extracts housing data from online property listing websites.

Cleans and prepares the data for machine learning.

Explores and analyzes the data to find key price-driving factors.

Builds a predictive model (using XGBoost).

Deploys the model with FastAPI into a user-friendly web application where users can input house details and instantly get a price estimate.
